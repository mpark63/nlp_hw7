That will produce much more output.  (This argument has always been available for the legacy API, and is available in the [Python bindings for open-source models such as Llama](https://pypi.org/project/llama-cpp-python/).  Those bindings also allow you to [constrain the output by an arbitrary CFG](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md), using `grammar=...`.  This is useful if you're generating code or data that must be syntactically valid to be useful to you.

The server has to re-encode it with the Transformer, and it charges us for doing so (see the \"input token\" costs in `tracking.py`).  \n",

    "Perhaps you can find a way to make use of this?  For example, the query formulation step of RAG could generate $n$ implicit claims instead of just one.  We could then look for claims in the Kialo database that are close to _any_ of those implicit claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to do with multiple completions is to select among them or combine them.  For example, suppose we prompt the LLM to generate completions of the form $(s,t,r)$ where $s$ is an answer, $t$ evaluates that answer, and $r$ is a numerical score or reward based on that evaluation.  (\"Write a poem, then tell us about its rhyme and rhythm problems, then give your score.\")  \n",
    "* If we sample multiple completions $(s_1,t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (s_n,t_n,r_n)$ in parallel, then we can return the $s_i$ whose $r_i$ is largest.  \n",
    "* Or if we sample $s$ and then multiple continuations $(t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (t_n,r_n)$, then we can return the mean score $\\sum_i r_i/n$ as a reduced-variance score for $s$, which averages over diverse textual evaluations that might consider different aspects of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you call the chat completions interface with $n > 1$, you specfy 1 shared input prompt and get $n$ different output completions.  Since the input prompt must be the same for all outputs, it is necessary to sample all of $(s,t,r)$ or all of $(t,r)$ with a single call to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to reduce latency by submitting multiple requests to the server in parallel (see \"async usage\" [https://pypi.org/project/openai/][here]).  In this case the input prompts can be different, although you now have to pay to encode all of them separately.  This facility could speed up evaluation without changing its results; that's a worthwhile thing to try for extra credit!\n"
